## elabzoo-holes

Minimal implementation of an elaborator with holes and pattern
unification. Extensive comments are included in the implementation.

- [Main.hs](Main.hs) contain the whole implementation and all explanations
  relevant to it.
- [pattern-unification.txt](pattern-unification.txt) is a formal
  description which you can almost certainly skip.
