## elabzoo-implicit-args

This package implements named implicit arguments following Agda convention and
behavior, with first-class implicit dependent function types.

The implicit argument insertion is based on section 2.6 of [Elaboration with first-class implicit function types](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408983), but we additionally support named implicit arguments
in the style of Agda.
