## elabzoo-sigma-unification

Unification modulo sigma types. WIP. Currently this package supports only eta-expansion and currying for metavariables, whereas Agda for instance also supports currying bound variables in local scope. I'm thinking about a different approach which should be significantly more efficient and powerful than the Agda solution.
