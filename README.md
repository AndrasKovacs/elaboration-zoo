See [MinimalTC.hs](MinimalTC.hs) for a minimal dependent type checker, based on Coquand's algorithm. See [MinimalTCHoles.hs](MinimalTCHoles.hs) for a minimal elaborator with holes and pattern unification. For something more substantial, look at [this](https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/smalltt) instead.
