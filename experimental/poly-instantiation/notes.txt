Problems with out-of date values
------------------------------------------------------------

  1. out-of-date values can cause eval crashes, because applications
     can become ill-typed if one side is out-of-date (mismatched telescope/plain
     applications).

  2. If we want to naively force in eval, we get crashes when trying to
     force metas, because it is possible that we evaluate in an old
     MCxt which does not contain some new metas.

Solution:
  1. Closures take MCxt as extra arguments. This ensures that the MCxt
     is always newer than the MCxt used for evaluating any value.

     E.g., in the old system it's possible to create a VLam closure
     which captures the old MCxt. Then we might instantiate the VLam
     with a newer value, and we get the situation where some values
     in the environment are newer than the MCxt.

  2. We force during evaluation:
    - We force appTel types, so we can do type-directed eval.
    - In implicit application, if the lhs is a telescope lambda,
      we force it.
    - We add forcing telescope lambdas and Pi-s to regular forcing
      (just a bugfix)


Problem with PiTel unification requiring pruning
------------------------------------------------------------

Solution: we restrict the PiTel refinement rule, so that only
a meta-headed PiTel domain type is refined. In that case, we
can create a fresh meta for the refined telescope tail which
depends on the same spine as the original meta.

Question: should we do spine check on refining, or should we just
proceed YOLO?
