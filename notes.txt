- First-order closures for Val-s seem the best idea
- Unfolding and rewrites on closures
- Non-reducing equality checks on closures
- How to infer unreduced Term and Type at the same time ("Glued" representation)
- Globals vs locals (scope closures everywhere a good idea?)

- Problem to solve: find "common ancestral" closure of two arbitrary closures
  - Necessary for lots of operations on unreduced terms in closures.
  - most simply: in the case of de Bruijn levels
    - We can get a 8 size closure by applying 4 arguments to a function in 4-size closure
      or by having a value in a 8-size closure - how do we know which variable points to common environment?
    - How can we systematically record ancestry/inclusion of environments?
    - Unsatisfactory solutions:
      - 1. Only work with whnf or nf. In this case, resolving substitutions eliminates closure dependency and ambiguity.
        - Why not good: we'd like to avoid unfolding when possible
      - 2. Assume a special immutable environment with unambiguous references within type checking scope ("top level constants")
           "Top level" references are unambiguous, therefore can be used in unfolded state. This strategy is probably employed by
            real-world type checkers to some degree.
        - Why not good:
          - we should try solving the most general case first and see if there's something to be learned
